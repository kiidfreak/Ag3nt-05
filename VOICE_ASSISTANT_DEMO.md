**Step 1: Open Voice Assistant**
- Click "Voice Assistant" button in Studio
- Show the multilingual interface with language selector
- Demonstrate language switching (English → Kiswahili → Spanish)

**Step 2: English Demo**
- Say: *"I want to create a research pipeline that collects papers from ArXiv, synthesizes findings with AI, and audits for quality"*
- Show real-time transcription
- Watch as AI generates:
  - Research Pipeline workflow
  - 3 agents: Source Collector, Research Synthesizer, Quality Auditor
  - Step-by-step implementation guide
  - Code snippets and configuration

**Step 3: Kiswahili Demo**
- Switch to Kiswahili
- Say: *"Nataka kuunda mfumo wa fedha ambao unachunguza mikopo na unahakikisha haki"*
- Translation: "I want to create a financial system that processes loans and ensures fairness"
- Show how it generates:
  - Finance Pipeline workflow
  - 6 agents: Bank Connector, KYC Verifier, Risk Scorer, Fairness Auditor, Decision Orchestrator
  - Kiswahili implementation instructions
  - Compliance and audit features

**Step 4: Implementation Guide**
- Show the generated workflow guide
- Demonstrate step-by-step instructions
- Show code snippets and configuration
- Highlight auto-progression through steps

#### 3. Advanced Features (1 minute)

**Multi-language Support**
- Show conversation history in different languages
- Demonstrate language-specific responses
- Show how the same workflow can be described in multiple languages

**Smart Workflow Generation**
- Show how the AI understands context
- Demonstrate agent selection based on requirements
- Show automatic connection mapping
- Highlight security and compliance features

#### 4. Closing Impact (30 seconds)
> "From idea to implementation in minutes, not months. Our voice assistant doesn't just understand what you want - it builds it for you, in your language, with enterprise-grade security and compliance built-in."

const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = selectedLanguage.code;
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
```

#### AI Workflow Generation
```typescript
// Natural language to workflow conversion
const workflow = await workflowGenerator.generateWorkflow({
  input: transcript,
  language: selectedLanguage.code,
  context: { industry: 'finance', complexity: 'complex' }
});
```

#### Multilingual Support
```typescript
// Language-specific patterns and responses
const patterns = {
  sw: {
    research: ['tafiti', 'uchunguzi', 'kuchambua'],
    finance: ['mkopo', 'krediti', 'fedha'],
    healthcare: ['afya', 'matibabu', 'mgonjwa']
  }
};
