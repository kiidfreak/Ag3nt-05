# Agent Labs OS Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision Statement

**"The Canva for Agents"** â€” A modular lab OS that makes multi-agent systems discoverable, composable, and deployable across real-world domains (trust, finance, compliance, human-in-the-loop).

## ðŸ§­ Guiding Principles

### 1. Composable & Reusable
- Agents are first-class, discoverable units
- Modular design enables easy composition
- Version control and backward compatibility
- Standardized interfaces and protocols

### 2. Zero-Trust Interop
- Every agent interaction is authenticated
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Time-locked operations when required
- Cryptographic verification of all actions

### 3. Pay-for-Use Economics
- On-chain micro-payments for agent usage
- Tokenized credits system
- Transparent pricing and billing
- Fair revenue sharing for agent creators

### 4. Human Oversight
- UI-first flows for approvals
- Easy human-in-the-loop fallback
- Clear consent mechanisms
- Transparent decision-making processes

### 5. Simple Onboarding
- Templates and demo apps
- Spaces-like environment for rapid prototyping
- Comprehensive documentation
- Community-driven learning resources
